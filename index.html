    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a balanced skill set in both frontend and backend development. 
      My main tools are Vue.js for dynamic interfaces and Laravel for robust backend solutions. 
      I am comfortable designing databases, creating REST APIs, implementing authentication and authorization,
      and building applications that solve real business needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not claiming to be an expert yet, but I have a solid foundation, a fast learning curve, 
      and a strong sense of discipline. I focus on completing projects efficiently while maintaining 
      a clean and scalable codebase. My aim is to gain professional experience and demonstrate my capacity 
      to deliver functional, well-structured software.

        <h4>GestiZone</h4>
        <p class="tech">Vue · Laravel · MySQL</p>

        <p>
          GestiZone is a full-stack incident and task management system built for internal company operations. 
          It allows users to create, assign, and track incidents in a structured workflow, supporting multiple user roles, 
          including standard users and administrators.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I built GestiZone from the ground up, designing the database, implementing backend logic with Laravel, 
          and creating a dynamic frontend interface with Vue. The project follows RESTful principles and includes 
          authentication, role-based access control, real-time updates, and file attachments.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The system demonstrates my approach to software development: designing scalable architecture, 
          writing maintainable code, and building features that address real-world needs. 
          It also shows my ability to handle both frontend and backend responsibilities, 
          and integrate them into a cohesive full-stack solution.
        </p>

          Screenshots below illustrate the main dashboard and incident workflow. Future plans include 
          enhancements like reporting modules, analytics dashboards, and user-friendly notifications.
