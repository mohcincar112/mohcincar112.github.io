      <p>
        I build complete web applications with a strong focus on clean architecture,
        real-world logic, and scalability. My goal is to grow as a professional developer
        by delivering solid and maintainable solutions.

  <section class="about" id="about">
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer with balanced experience in both frontend and backend development.
      I work mainly with Vue and Laravel, building applications that include authentication, role management,
      REST APIs, database design, and real business logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not claiming to be an expert — yet. What I do have is a strong foundation, the ability to learn fast,
      and the discipline to finish what I start. I am currently focused on gaining real experience through
      professional internships and hands-on projects.

        <h4>GestiZone</h4>
        <p class="tech">Vue · Laravel · MySQL</p>

        <p>
          GestiZone is a full-stack incident and task management system designed for internal company use.
          The application includes user authentication, role-based access control, and a complete workflow
          for creating, assigning, updating, and closing incidents.
        </p>

        <p>
          I developed the entire project from scratch, including database design, backend API,
          frontend interface, and application logic. The backend is built with Laravel following
          REST principles, while the frontend uses Vue to provide a responsive and dynamic user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          The system supports different user roles (standard users and administrators),
          real-time data updates, file attachments, and structured status management.
          This project reflects how I approach real-world problems: clean structure,
          scalability in mind, and practical solutions.
